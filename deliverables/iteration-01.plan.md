# Snacker

## Iteration 01

* Start date: Sep 18, 2018
* End date: Oct 14, 2018

## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

For this iteration, everyone is responsible for generating ideas and participating in the discussions to produce a good project design. Everyone is also responsible for writing the deliverable documents.


The roles which team members decided to take:

- Scrum master: Juliano;

- Project manager: Adam;

- Front end lead: Alex;

- Back end lead: Harry;

- Note taking: Jayde;

**OBS:** Developers: everyone.

#### Events

We plan to have in person retrospectives/review meetings during tutorials. We will also have a planning meeting every week to test if the current system works.


The purpose of the retrospective is to review our progress and any concerns about development, communication and any other issues. For planning meetings, we will prioritize tasks for the upcoming sprint and assign the work to each member. Planning meetings will happen either during tutorial meetings or with the use of online platforms.


Currently we have a planned meeting to get everyone’s development environment set up for the project software development. We will also discuss and  review the tech-stack we decide on.

#### Artifacts

Currently we have a Trello board for tasks. Each person is accountable for their own commitment. If one person cannot reach their commitment, we will re-prioritize the tasks for the next sprint. We will usually prioritize tasks that need to be released for the final product over bugs in production. Depending on the impact of the bug, we may increase its priority over new features. Tasks are assigned depending on the priority of the task and the “area of expertise” of the team member, such as Back end, Front end, etc.


We also have a Google drive folder that stores all documents related to our project, so that members can edit them in real time. Since we didn't have our Github repositories at the beginning of the collaboration process, we started using Google drive.

Some specific documents that we used to organize the team include:
* A document for members to keep track of their ideas for the app  [Brainstormed Ideas Record](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HIz9iWERbfbjXMLSlUGoFzjWEtrcn9UZ5tYSw8XyAyY/edit?usp=sharing)
* A document to keep track of members' skill sets [Team member skillset Record](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1riy3x4aIyMRrWx_dGIKMRx8mTvMNrbBqOT9Y_UK14ak/edit?usp=sharing)
* A document to keep track of inital FYFB stuff and initial project idea brainstorming phase [Initial Project Planning Record](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bO1K0x_Pc-s6SVEmBnhessNr2z6z1iQZ4c8CjTYVOOE/edit?usp=sharing)

## Product


#### Goals and tasks

Our goals for this iteration are to decide on which product we are going to build, what features our product is going to have, how our product is going to serve the users, what our product is going to look like, and to make sure that our team has the ability to develop our product.


List of tasks in order of priority: decide on the stack/framework/database -> setup everyone’s dev environment -> develop basic front end -> decide on and set up database scheme -> develop functionalities which allow us to: create an experimental account -> log in -> search a snack -> create a snack -> read a snack -> review a snack -> verify a snack -> obtain a snack recommendation -> manage wishlist -> polish front end.


For deliverable 2, we should go through the list of goals and end with the user account being able to create a snack. Our web application should be running at least locally, with features such as creating an account/logging in/searching a snack/creating a snack working properly.


By deliverable 3, we should finish everything from the list, and our web application should be running online, with all proposed functionalities working.

#### Artifacts


For this iteration, our presentable artifacts include :
* The 3 documents (namely *product.md, iteration-01.plan.md and iteration-01.review.md*)
* [The user diagram](resources/d1/UML.png)
* The website [wireframes](resources/d1)
* The [personas](https://app.xtensio.com/nbimdqra)
   * Young Everyday Snacker Jane
   * Traveller Albert
   * Snack Distributor - Shop owner Jack
   * Snack Manufacturer - Oreo management team member May


For deliverable 2, aside from the web app running locally (or on heroku) with basic features to show, we plan to create a video and a class diagram to present our application.
For deliverable 3, we should have a running web application and a video explaining all its features.
