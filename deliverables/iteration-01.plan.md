# Snacker

## Iteration 01

* Start date: Sep 18, 2018
* End date: Oct 14, 2018

## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

For this iteration, everyone is responsible for generating ideas and participating in discussions to produce a good project design. Everyone is also responsible for writing the deliverable documents.


Looking into the future, here are some roles some teammates take on:

- Scrum master: Juliano;

- Project manager: Adam;

- Front end lead: Alex;

- Backend lead: Harry;

- Note taking: Jayde;

**OBS:** Everyone is also a developer.

#### Events

We plan to have retrospectives/review during tutorial meetings. We will also have a planning meeting every week to test if this current system works. Since retrospectives will have during tutorial meetings, it will be face-to-face.


Purpose of the retrospective is to review our progress and any concerns with development, communication, and/or other issues. For planning meetings, we will prioritize tasks for the upcoming sprint and delegation of work. These will either be in tutorial meetings so face-to-face or over online platforms.


We currently have an event for getting everyone’s development environment setup for the project. This also includes which IDE we will use and the review of the decided tech-stack.

#### Artifacts

We currently have a trello board for tasks. Each person is accountable for their own commitment. Since we are all on the same ship, if one person cannot reach their commitment we will re-prioritize their and others’ tasks for the next sprint. We will prioritize tasks that need to be released for the final product over bugs in production usually. Depending on the impact of the bug, we will prioritize that over new features. Tasks are assigned depending on the priority of the task and the “area” of the member, such as Backend, Frontend, etc.


We also have a google drive folder that stores all word type documents related to our project so members can edit them in real time. Since we didn't received our Github repo, we started on google drive.

## Product


#### Goals and tasks

Our goals for this iteration is to decide on which product we are going to build, what features our product is going to have, how our product is going to serve the users, what our product is going look like, and to make sure our team has the ability to develop our product.


List of task in order of priority: decide on the stack/framework/database -> setup everyone’s dev environment -> basic frontend -> decide on and set up database scheme -> create an account -> login -> search a snack -> create a snack -> read a snack -> review a snack -> verify a snack -> snack recommendation -> wishlist -> polish frontend.


For deliverable 2, we should go through the list and finish creating a snack, and our web app should at least be running locally with features such as create an account/login/search a snack/create a snack to show.


By deliverable 3, we should finish everything and our web app should be running publicly with all proposed functionalities working.

#### Artifacts


For this iteration, our presentable artifacts include :
* These 3 documents (namely *product.md, iteration-01.plan.md and iteration-01.review.md*)
* [The user diagram](resources/d1/UML.png)
* The website [wireframes](resources/d1)
* The [personas](https://app.xtensio.com/nbimdqra)
   * Young Everyday Snacker Jane
   * Traveller Albert
   * Snack Distributor - Shop owner Jack
   * Snack Manufacturer - Oreo management team member May


For deliverable 2, aside from the web app running locally (or on heroku) with basic features to show, we plan to create a video and class diagram to further illustrate our app to public.
For deliverable 3, we should have a fully publicly running web app and a video explaining all features.
